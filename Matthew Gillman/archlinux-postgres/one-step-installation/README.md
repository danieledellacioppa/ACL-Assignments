# one step installation

let's try to summarize the essential steps to make sure postgres is installed flawlessly on every linux system with more stability than archlinux

```
sudo pacman -S postgresql
```

with this command the user postgres gets created so let us put it in the sudoers straight away and let us assign a password to it

```
sudo passwd postgres
```

```
sudo visudo 
```

now give to postgres the same privilegs as root. Just copy whatever is stated for root and replace root with postgres and then you can save and exit the vi environment

```
sudo -iu postgres
```

#### shell output
[postgres@daniele-virtualbox2 ~]$ psql
psql: error: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?

---

```
initdb -D /var/lib/postgres/data
```


the output is this

### shell output

initdb: warning: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

Success. You can now start the database server using:
pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgres/data -l logfile start

```
pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgres/data -l logfile start

```


gives the following error



#### error output

pg_ctl: could not start server
Examine the log output.

```
systemctl restart postgresql.service
systemctl enable postgresql.service

```


the output was

#### shell output

```
psql

this is what you should get hopefully
