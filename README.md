English-Assessment
------

The English assessment was just about writing two scenarios:
* a complaint letter to the local MP asking to stop charging for parking in the hospital car park
* a letter from a security guard in the hospital during the night shift when an accident happend


PC-Components
------

This is a proper LateX document to complete the task assigned by Andrew Bassey demaning to describe the principal
parts of a computer and going into further details if time allows. It doesn't have to be the complete final form
but I have to have something to show before Wednesday the 12th of January 2022.

So this document is just an excuse to get hands dirty with LateX. It's very far from the final version as I don't 
have time to do it all in one go
