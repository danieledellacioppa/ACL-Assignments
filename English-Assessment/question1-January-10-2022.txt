To the MP Jeremy Corbyn,

The reason I'm writing this to you is to briefly inform you that patients being visited at Whittington Hospital are being charged excessively due to extremely long waiting times because of shortage of staff the hospital is facing at the moment during the pandemic we're unfortunately still facing.
The way I would suggest to face the problem is by getting reasonably charged just for the first two hours and then starting from the third hour onwards not getting charged at all.
The reason why I'm asking this is because the whole pandemic brought us to spend more money to buy medicines, covid tests, getting vaccinated privately since the NHS is overwhelmed, getting self isolated in private hotels when travelling from abroad, etc. It would be nice to be able to save at least the money patients are being charged since they usually have to have their cars parked for more than 6 hours at the Whittington Accidents and Emergencies parking area.
I am fully aware that the government is facing a hard time since the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union for good, and the pandemic is making the challenge to get the costs under control even harder, but If there is any chance you can do anything in this regard it would be very much appreciated since many patients attending visits at the hospital and my self included are struggling with the situation although many of them are in receipt of Universal Credit already.

Thanks very much for you attention

Kind regards

Daniele
