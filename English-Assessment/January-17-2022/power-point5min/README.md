## addictions

if you find at some point you have any addiction what you can do is writing.

Nobody is watching you and what you write has to remain secret. Nobody can read it. Because what you write is the truth.
If you are true to yourself you might end up saying things that the 'monster' is trying to sell you and you're buying everyday

The monster is the part of your brain watching that portion of reality upside down only to allow yourself to keep going with your addictive behaviour

Being honest to yourself and say why you do what you do might sound obvious at a first stage but then you might realize is isn't

When you realize that the time has come to write again and soon because otherwise you'll forget.

An example is :
```
why do you smoke?
```

**Because I like it.**


End of the story. The answer you gave you think is true. And you can continue smoking happily.
It's very important to understand that no effort is needed. Effort is something you use to make difficult things.
With the use of effort you're telling yourself is hard stuff to achieve. You are already failing before starting. You're not allowing yourself to set your mind properly.

Another important point is. There is no strategy. Is just the truth. Your truth. Which is not single. There are as many truths as the milliseconds of your life.

You might come up one day and add :

```
well if you like smoking. Why are you thinking to quit?
```

and you'll probably say
**because is expensive**

so you could go
```
so if it was free would you do it the whole life?
```

and then a disgusting feeling comes in your mind thinking about the whole life smoking and it's really all about putting it down before it fades.

Just say:

smoking the whole lifetime is disgusting and terrifying

**why?**

```

because I have to do it. I don't choose to do it. I have to.
```

**would still say that you love doing something that you must do?**

At this point the wall cracks and you realize you don't like smoking. You have to do it which is different.

There are about 7 or 8 walls you have to destroy and this one was just a crack in the first wall.

This is not self explainatory. It needs me to talk about it. It's just to give a rough idea of what my presentation is going to be
