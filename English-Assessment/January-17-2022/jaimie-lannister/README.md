# JAIMIE OLIVER talking about rubbish food

## questions

* Every children eats lots of sugar. It's everywhere but how can we trust the supermarkets? Can we trust an organic one? Is it going to be more expensive?
Can we afford it? Should we actually go and live outside London and live abroad in a natural area?

* If everyone teaches everybody how to cook restaurants might close or at least try to work better and maybe make better prices. Isn't this going to impact on waiters salary?
