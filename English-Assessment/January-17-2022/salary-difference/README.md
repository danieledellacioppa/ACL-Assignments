## Gender pay gap

Many women tend to choose occupations that offer less financial reward for example, in administration
Many high-paying sectors are disproportionately made up of male workers, for example, information and communications technology.

A much higher proportion of women work part-time, and part-time workers earn less than their full-time counterparts on average.

Women are still less likely to progress up the career ladder into high-paying senior roles.

At the moment the GAP is sligthly over than 18%


The government now :
* requires large employers to publish their gender pay gap. But will employers really do that or will they find a workaround to show fake numbers?
* offers 30 hours to take care of childrens with 3 and 4 years old. Isn't that a too short gap of time?

Only 8 Banks in the top 100 in Germany had women as thei chief executives. Why are we so scared of letting women to just any kind of job? what's the point of that?
