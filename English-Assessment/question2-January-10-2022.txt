To the head of the hospital,

While being on my night shift, there has been a robbery at hospital and a getaway lead by someone in a 1999 black BWM 735 with 06 in the plate, roughly two hours before leaving, at 5am.
What I had to do was to leave my position at the reception to help with an accident that took place in the hospital on the second floor in the room 15 with a patient who got severly injured to his leg reporting several gun shot wounds.
The patient is now being taken by the ambulance to another hospital to get a more apppriate treatment. In the meantime my position at the reception has been left unconvered for like 3 hours or something since I finished 1 hour late.
Normally I finish at 7am. At the moment I'm writing you from the University College Hospital and I'm still with the patient who still didn't get anyone to stay with him except me.
With that being said if there is any trouble I might have caused with that, just drop me an email or call me on 07491954954 and I'll sort it out as soon as I possibly can

Thanks

Daniele
