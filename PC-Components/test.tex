\section{Introduction}
In this document,we explain several parts \index{Introduction} of the Personal Computer
and every one of them should appear in the Index\index{Introduction} above.

Terms like generate\index{generate} and some\index{others} 
will also show up. Terms in the index can also be 
nested \index{Index!nested}

\section{Central Processor Unit}
This section\index{CPU, Processor} spends some words on the main component of a PC 
which is the Processor usually addressed as CPU.
This is the piece of hardware that phisically executes \emph{software} instructions one at at time.


%Let $D$ be a subset of $\bf R$ and let
%$f \colon D \to \mathbf{R}$ be a real-valued function on
%$D$. The function $f$ is said to be \emph{continuous} on
%$D$ if, for all $\epsilon > 0$ and for all $x \in D$,
%there exists some $\delta > 0$ (which may depend on $x$)
%such that if $y \in D$ satisfies
%\[ |y - x| < \delta \]
%then
%\[ |f(y) - f(x)| < \epsilon. \]

%One may readily verify that if $f$ and $g$ are continuous
%functions on $D$ then the functions $f+g$, $f-g$ and
%$f.g$ are continuous. If in addition $g$ is everywhere
%non-zero then $f/g$ is continuous.
